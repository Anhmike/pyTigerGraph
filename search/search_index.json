If you already have an API authorization token, specify that one as well. Alternatively, if you know a secret (created previously in the database), you can request a token via the getToken function and use it during the session. If user authentication is not enabled, then username, password and authorization token are not used (i.e. the database is insecure). This is only acceptable in case of development or study environments. The username and password default to the TigerGraph default username and password, which are tigergraph . If user authentication is enabled, the tigergraph user's password can't be tigergraph, so a different one must be selected. Furthermore, it is recommended not to use the tigergraph user for anything other than system administration. Instead, create additional users and grant them the appropriate privileges through roles , then use those users to access the database.","title":"Authentication"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING/","text":"Contribute to pyTigerGraph It is easy!

Documentation: DELETE /graph/{graph_name}/vertices delVerticesById delVerticesById(vertexType, vertexIds, permanent=False, timeout=0) Deletes vertices from graph identified by their ID. Arguments: - vertexIds : A single vertex ID or a list of vertex IDs. - permanent : If true, the deleted vertex IDs can never be inserted back, unless the graph is dropped or the graph store is cleared. - timeout : Time allowed for successful execution (0 = no limit, default).

Arguments: - where : Comma separated list of conditions that are all applied on each vertex' attributes. The conditions are in logical conjunction (i.e. they are \"AND'ed\" together). Uses: - If vertexType = \"*\": vertex count of all vertex types ( where cannot be specified in this case) - If vertexType is specified only: vertex count of the given type - If vertexType and where are specified: vertex count of the given type after filtered by where condition(s) See documentation for valid values of where condition.

Data is upserted: - If vertex is not yet present in graph, it will be created. - If it's already in the graph, its attributes are updated with the values specified in the request. An optional operator controls how the attributes are updated. The attributes argument is expected to be a dictionary in this format: {<attribute_name>, <attribute_value>|(<attribute_name>, <operator>), \u2026} Example: {\"name\": \"Thorin\", \"points\": (10, \"+\"), \"bestScore\": (67, \"max\")} Returns a single number of accepted (successfully upserted) vertices (0 or 1).
